# LoRa-Alarma
An alarm yells when the Dissolved Oxygen drops under 4.0mg/L

The data is received from the [LoRa-Sender](https://github.com/Calbetense/LoRa-Sender) system, where the sensor is placed and processed.

In the future, it can be used to alarm of critical events from other parameters.

The siren is 12V-500mA and 120dB from GLK - Eletr√¥nica activated with a 2N2222 TRT.
